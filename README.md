# Challenge

This ticket has been assigned to you, close it!

**Problem**

The management is complaining that they keep deactivating member by mistake by mis-clicking the deactivate button 
in the users list.

**Proposed work**

We should add a confirmation modal before deactivating a user.

**Design**

Our designer created this simple design, as a note he added that he is still working on a new icon set and we can ignore it for the time being.

**Nice to have**

During out user testing it appears that some user will appreciate to close the modal by using the escape key or by
clicking outside the modal. As we are on a tight deadline we should keep this as a nice-to-have.

**Limitations**

Do not use any additional libraries.

**Acceptance Critera**

- When I click on deactivate in the User list, I should see a confirmation modal
- Once the modal is open, When click on Cancel, nothing happen and the modal close
- Once the modal is open, When I click on Deactivate the user is removed from the list

# Closing thoughts

Your time is precious: do not take more than 2 hour to finish the challenge. 
As in every project, you may have to make some tradeoff. 
Keep in mind that less is more and every detail count: do less but do it well.

Good luck!
